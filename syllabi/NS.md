# Networks and Systems

## Description

Networks & systems form the boundry between abstractions firmly rooted in language and
deeper questions in computing regarding the implementation of thinking machines at engineer-
ing and physical levels. This course will prepare computer scientists to reason at and across this
abstraction boundry to more fully embrace the power of computation.
Students will learn low level languages of C and assembly, use command line tools to study these
languages, use features of the operating system including parallelism and networking, and learn
how to make changes to operating systems.

## Coursework

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

### Networking

1. Send and receive packets over the Internet
2. Interface with different network layers of the OSI model

### Operating Systems

1. Understand the role of operating systems in secure computing, especially kernel mode
2. Understand modern operating system design decisions
3. Interface with operating systems at different abstraction levels, including APIs
4. Program effectively with respect to interrupts and I/O
5. Patch the kernel

### Parallelism

1. Parallelize code using processes or threads
2. Send and receive packets between parallel processes or threads
3. Reason about benefits, such as performance, and risks, such as race conditions

### Command Line

1. Use command line tools to study computing systems' state and performance
2. Use version control
3. Use a debugger
4. Use a compiler

### Assembly

1. Understand control flow as a state machine
2. Relate code to underlying hardware
3. Convert C to Assembly and vice versa

### Security

1. Reason about a system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
2. Discuss basic principles of secure design, including open source and cost tradeoffs
3. Understand the impact of choice of language on secure design
4. Handle errors gracefully
