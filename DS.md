# Data Structures

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

### Recursive Data Structures & Relevant Methods

1. Save, retrieve, and remove data from a linked list using traversal
2. Implement queues and stacks using linked lists as well as built-in list types
3. Sort data with linked lists, binary search trees, or heaps.
4. Save, retrieve, and remove data from a hash table usingh hashing functions

### Theory

1. Differentiate types, such as data types, function types, and class types, in Python
2. Differentiate values and references in data structure implementations.
3. Understand Big O notation for measuring the efficiency of computation in time and space

### Programming

1. Solve problems using either iteration or recursion
2. Reason about base and recursive cases for recursive solutions
3. Develop classes in Python given specific requirements
4. Apply built-in Python types to create more sophisticated data structures

### Application

1. Encode meaningful data digitally effectively for different uses
2. Create programs of higher performance by understanding implementation details
3. Indentify and argue effectively for efficient solutions to challenging problems
