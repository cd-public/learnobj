# CS2013 Learning Objectives @ Willamette

Developed using the methodology demonstrated by Roberts:
https://willamette.edu/~esroberts/ACM-CS2013/

CS1 objectives lifted from Roberts with two proposals, all others developed independently then cross-referenced.

## Curriculum

Curriculum directory contains an "all" and one file for each in-major non-ethics course in the proposed 7 course core that I conceptual organize in 3 two course sequences. Since names are a bit in flux, they are used here as:
* CS1/DS (= Computer Science 1, Data Structures = Intro Sequence)
* SW/Sys (= Software, Systems = Engineering Sequence)
* M251/Alg (= MATH 251, CLRS Algorithms = Theory Sequence)
* Ethics (= DATA XXX = Writing)

Each file includes CS2013 learning objects after my high level summary of content and diff with Roberts. I've included a few notes on names in some cases.

As a rule, I tried to prefix commentary with 'cd: ' and best effort description was unprefixed.

## cd: Discussion questions
* (1) How much should we tailor coverage to this? 
	* E.G. I think AR matters more than FSMs, max flow/linear programming more than formal Big O, NP reduction more than counting. 
	* These seem heavily lecture based and survey oriented, rather than identifying helpful areas to study in depth.
	* This is heavily slant "familiarity" in a way I think is unhelpful to students who want to understand details.
* (2) How early should we introduce graphs/proofs. 
	* Can do instead of hashing in DS and move hashing to Sys (applied) or Alg (theory) 
	* I want graphs in DS (for double majors) but then we have to hash somewhere and don't have a required security course (where it is now).
* (3) Do we address required high level topics, like shared memory, without lower elective topics like MMUs & real/virtual memory.
	* I think students are doing better with underlying hardware than underlying math.
* (4) Do we need to look at Tier 2 & Elective or learning objectives from other sources?
* (5) Should we understand CS2013 as about education, job placement, or something else?
	* I struggled to make sense of what I felt were contradictory design choices in topics coverage.
