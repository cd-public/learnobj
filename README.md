# CS2013 Learning Objectives

## Courses
* CS1/DS (Intro Sequence)
* SW/Sys (Engineering Sequence)
* M251/Alg (Theory Sequence)
* Ethics (Writing)

## cd: Discussion questions
* (1) How much should we tailor coverage to this? 
	* E.G. I think AR matters more than FSMs, max flow/linear programming more than formal Big O, NP reduction more than counting. 
	* These seem heavily lecture based and survey oriented, rather than identifying helpful areas to study in depth.
	* This is heavily slant "familiarity" in a way I think is unhelpful to students who want to understand details.
* (2) How early should we introduce graphs/proofs. Can do instead of hashing and move hashing to Sys (applied) or Alg (theory) 
	* I want graphs in DS (for double majors) but then we have to hash somewhere and don't have a required security course (where it is now).
* (3) How do we address required high level topics, like shared memory, without lower level elective topics like MMUs and real/virtual memory.
