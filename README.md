# CS2013 Learning Objectives @ Willamette

## Courses
* CS1/DS (= Computer Science 1, Data Structures = Intro Sequence)
* SW/Sys (= Software, Systems = Engineering Sequence)
* M251/Alg (= MATH 251, CLRS Algorithms = Theory Sequence)
* Ethics (= DATA XXX = Writing)

## cd: Discussion questions
* (1) How much should we tailor coverage to this? 
	* E.G. I think AR matters more than FSMs, max flow/linear programming more than formal Big O, NP reduction more than counting. 
	* These seem heavily lecture based and survey oriented, rather than identifying helpful areas to study in depth.
	* This is heavily slant "familiarity" in a way I think is unhelpful to students who want to understand details.
* (2) How early should we introduce graphs/proofs. 
	* Can do instead of hashing in DS and move hashing to Sys (applied) or Alg (theory) 
	* I want graphs in DS (for double majors) but then we have to hash somewhere and don't have a required security course (where it is now).
* (3) Do we address required high level topics, like shared memory, without lower elective topics like MMUs & real/virtual memory.
	* I think students are doing better with underlying hardware than underlying math.
* (4) Do we need to look at Tier 2 & Elective or learning objectives from other sources?
